# A singly linked list implemenation in C

I built this after watching a video of [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts) talk about how Git is essentially a singly linked list.

Quite a few things tripped me up whilst building this, especially understanding the mechanics of passing a pointer to an address in heap memory to a function and manipulating bits at that location within the function - very tricky indeed!

Nevertheless, it was a lot of fun!
